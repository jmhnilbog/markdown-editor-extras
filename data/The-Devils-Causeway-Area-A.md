# The Devil's Causeway

Eerily quiet. Wind through foilage. A breeze seems to pull the air, and the party, towards the Keep{.aside}

_An old dirt road, unkempt and overrun with sickly vegetation, atop an earthen ramp leading to the fallen drawbridge of the ruined citadel. **Two man-like figures wrapped in long, ropey vines** stand unmoving, arms outstreched, in the center of the path._

Overall impression: Eerily quiet. A breeze seems to pull the air towards the Keep.

From Afar: _An old dirt road, overrun with weeds and sickly vines, atop the earthen ramp leading to the Keep's fallen drawbridge. Two figures stand in the road ahead, wrapped in long, ropey vines and supported by wooden poles._

Closer: _The vine-wrapped figures were once living men, now hideously entangled. Tendrils have wormed their way into eyes, ears, mouths. A_

Description:

_An old dirt road, now overrun with weeds and sickly vines, rises towards the ruined citadel. A grisly sight bars your way: a pair of bodies, secured to poles by long ropey vines. The wicked vines have wormed their way inside the bodies’ eyes, ears, and mouths. To your horror, you realize the bodies are still moving._

**Vine Horrors (2):** Init +2; Atk vine +2 melee (1d4); AC 13; HD 2d10; hp 10 each; MV 20’; Act 2d20; SP entangle (automatic 1d6 damage on next round if both vine attacks land; DC 15 Str check to escape), death throes (seeds); SV Fort +2, Ref +0, Will +2; AL C.

- **Entangle:** If both vines strike the same victim in one round, they entangle the target, automatically inflicting 1d6 points of crushing and choking damage on the following round. An entangled victim can win free with a DC 15 Strength check.
- **Death Throes:** On the attack that kills a vine horror, the host corpse splits open, spilling out thousands of small seeds slick with mucus. The seeds become unviable in 12 hours but can move 1 foot per hour until then. If a seed reaches a corpse before expiring, the corpse rises as a vine horror in 1d4 days.

Vine Horrors are corpses animated by foul vines growing from seeds planted in their chests. The rotting bodies serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed pods for future vine horrors. Each horror attacks twice per round, flailing with its long, ropey vines.

</aside>

The Judge may wish to ask players if any of the characters are blacksmiths, or often interacted with the village blacksmith, as it is possible that one or more members of the party may recognize the corpses at a distance. The two corpses are those of **Keary** and **Alban**, the grown sons of the smith, who vanished from the village eleven days ago. The beastmen killed the brothers and seeded their corpses with vine horrors to ward off any investigations from the townsfolk.

The horrors’ true nature becomes apparent when the characters approach. The vines unwind from the posts, freeing the horrors to shamble toward the PCs.

Keary’s corpse is still carrying a **short sword** and **dagger** (gifts forged by his father), and Alban’s corpse has **5 cp** hidden in its right boot.
