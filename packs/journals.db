Now the ruins seem host only to creeping vines and the foul miasma that drifts down from the keep.\n\nThe **air is overrun with pestilence**. Fat flies bite at you incessantly, and **clouds of small black insects** choke your every breath. The long-abandoned land is **choked with thorny vines** that drape the **sickly trees** and hang from the **ruined walls**. There is an **odor of rot and decay**, as if the hill itself were decomposing from within.\n\nA sight gives you pause: **a ragged banner, depicting a crimson skull on a black field**, stands high atop the ruined walls. Whatever lurks within has terrorized you and your village for far too long.\n\nYou turn to your companions and ready your meager weapons. The time for retribution has come.\n\n:::\n\n::: features\n\n- The keep’s **walls rise 30 feet from their rammed earth embankments**. See below for climbing details.\n- The walls and all the fallen stones are **covered in a patchwork of moss, sickly vines, and lichen**.\n- Rather than simple carved blocks, the keep seems to have been **built of enormous standing stones and mighty dolmens**. The blocks are fitted together crudely, leaving **cracks between the stones** for rotting vegetation and pools of water that act as host to the **gnats and mosquitoes**.\n\n:::\n\n\nThe PCs are free to enter as they see fit.\n\n- While the **most obvious approach takes them up the @JournalEntry[Devil's Causeway]**, this is also the most dangerous. Wily characters will be rewarded for their suspicion, though hesitation should never be mistaken for caution.\n- **Approaching from the west** requires the characters to ascend the @JournalEntry[Ruined Wall]. Picking their way through the fallen blocks is not difficult, but carries its own risks.\n- **Approaching from northeast** brings the PCs directly to the @JournalEntry[Sinkhole].\n- Characters **attempting to ascend walls** face a difficult climb. Each character attempting to scale the walls must succeed on a ***DC 15 climb check*** or fall 20 feet ***for 2d6 damage*** before tumbling down to the base of the rammed earth mound. Remember that falls also include a **chance of broken bones**; each ***6*** rolled adds a broken bone and permanent loss of ***1 Strength or Agility*** as described in @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-text.MNAG6rNKx8YEo1ry]{Chapter 4: Combat}.\n\n:::\n\n::: triggers\n\nBy Day {.day}\n: The keep betrays no obvious signs of patrols.\n\nAt Dusk {.dusk}\n: Two beastmen (from above the @JournalEntry[Gatehouse]) light torches on the ruined battlements.\n\tThe glow of the @JournalEntry[Sinkhole] becomes more obvious.\n\t\nAt Night {.night}\n: Torches and the @JournalEntry[Sinkhole] throw weird shadows. Glimpses of the beastmen above the @JournalEntry[Gatehouse] may be seen. The beastmen within the @JournalEntry[Tower of the Beast] patrol the Keep instead of waiting in place. They need no light.\n\nOutrageous behavior\n: If the beastmen just can't ignore what the PCs are doing, **all beastmen present within the scene attack** as near the @JournalEntry[Well of Souls] as possible, trying to hurl adventurers into the pit. **Such behavior increases the chance of random encounters by 1 for the duration of the adventure**.\n\nStakeout\n: Each hour of watching the keep gives a **1 in 3** chance of encountering a @Actor[Beastman] party of [[2d3]] at a distance of [[1d6*10]] feet.\n\nRandom Encounters\n: There is a base **1 in 10** chance of a random encounter every turn within the scene. @RollTable[The Ruined Keep Random Encounters].\n:::","img":"modules/sailors-on-the-starless-sea/assets/handouts/Scene-The-Ruined-Keep.png","_id":"FanguXBGkfMsM4gg"}

The seeds become unviable in 12 hours but can move 1 foot per hour until then. If a seed reaches a corpse before expiring, the corpse rises as a vine horror in 1d4 days.\n\n:::\n\nVine Horrors are corpses animated by foul vines growing from seeds planted in their chests. The rotting bodies serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed pods for future vine horrors.
