<dt>Death Throes</dt>
<dd>On the attack that kills a vine horror, the host corpse splits open, spilling out thousands of small seeds slick with mucus. The seeds become unviable in 12 hours but can move 1 foot per hour until then. If a seed reaches a corpse before expiring, the corpse rises as a vine horror in 1d4 days.</dd>

<p><strong>Vine Horrors</strong> are <strong>corpses animated by foul vines</strong> growing from seeds planted in their chests. The rotting bodies serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed pods for future vine horrors. Each horror <strong>attacks twice per round</strong>, flailing with its long, ropey vines, <strong>entangling</strong> and choking. <strong>When killed, all but the freshest vine horrors spill viable seeds</strong>.</p>
