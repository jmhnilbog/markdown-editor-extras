Eerily quiet. Wind through foilage. A breeze seems to pull the air, and the party, towards the Keep.

==An old dirt road, unkempt and overrun with sickly vegetation, atop an earthen ramp leading to the fallen drawbridge of the ruined citadel. **Two man-like figures wrapped in long, ropey vines** stand unmoving, arms outstreched, in the center of the path.== {.read-aloud}

Approaching closer
: ==You can see the two figures are corpses, attached to poles by a mass of vines. The vines worms in and out of the bodies' eyes, ears, and mouths.==

If any characters knew the blacksmith
: The corpses are those of **Keary** and **Alban**, sons of the village smith. They vanished from the village eleven days ago.

Whenever appropriate
: ==To your horror, you realize the bodies are still moving! THe vines untangle from their poles and the corpse begins to walk!== {.read-aloud}
: 2x @Actor[Vine Horror] {.hazard}

If the corpses are searched
: Keary’s corpse is still carrying a @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-weapons.Short sword] and @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-weapons.Dagger]
 forged by his father
: Alban’s corpse has 5 cp hidden in its right boot.

Area A – Devil’s Causeway: An old dirt road, now overrun
with weeds and sickly vines, rises towards the ruined citadel. A
grisly sight bars your way: a pair of bodies, secured to poles by long
ropey vines. The wicked vines have wormed their way inside the bodies’
eyes, ears, and mouths. To your horror, you realize the bodies are
still moving.
The bodies are vine horrors: corpses animated by the foul
vines growing from seeds planted in their chests. The rotting
bodies serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed
pods for future vine horrors.
The horrors’ true nature becomes apparent when the characters
approach. The vines unwind from the posts, freeing the
horrors to shamble toward the PCs. Each horror attacks twice
per round, flailing with its long, ropey vines.
If both vines strike the same victim in one round, they entangle
the target, automatically inflicting 1d6 points of crushing
and choking damage on the following round. An entangled
victim can win free with a DC 15 Strength check.
Vine Horrors (2): Init +2; Atk vine +2 melee (1d4); AC 13; HD
2d10; hp 10 each; MV 20’; Act 2d20; SP entangle (automatic
1d6 damage on next round if both vine attacks land; DC 15 Str
check to escape); SV Fort +2, Ref +0, Will +2; AL C.
On the attack that kills a vine horror, the host corpse splits
open, spilling out thousands of small seeds slick with mucus.
The seeds become unviable in 12 hours but can move 1 foot
per hour until then. If a seed reach a corpse before expiring,
the corpse rises as a vine horror in 1d4 days.
The corpses belonged to Keary and Alban, sons of the village
smith. The brothers vanished from the village eleven days
ago. The beastmen killed the brothers and seeded their corpses
with vine horrors to ward off any investigations from the
townsfolk. Keary’s corpse is still carrying a short sword and
dagger (gifts forged by his father), and Alban’s corpse has 5 cp
hidden in its right boot.
