        Death Throes
        : On the attack that kills a vine horror, the host corpse splits open, spilling out thousands of small seeds slick with mucus. The seeds become unviable in 12 hours but can move 1 foot per hour until then. If a seed reaches a corpse before expiring, the corpse rises as a vine horror in 1d4 days.

**Vine Horrors** are **corpses animated by foul vines** growing from seeds planted in their chests. The rotting bodies serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed pods for future vine horrors. Each horror **attacks twice per round**, flailing with its long, ropey vines, **entangling** and choking. **When killed, all but the freshest vine horrors spill viable seeds**.
